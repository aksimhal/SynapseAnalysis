# SACT Example

Example scripts for running SACT.  `example_runme.py` provides an example usage of the tool and can be run with the following line: 
 ```
 python example_runme.py
 ```

 Prior to running these files, follow the install instructions listed here: <https://aksimhal.github.io/SynapseAnalysis/>.  In this script, there are two clones of the PSD-95 antibody, called `PSD95m_1st.tif` and `PSD95r_2nd.tif` and both are tested against the same reference antibody, `synapsin_1st.tif`.  The file contains a function, `psd_pairwise_comparison()`.  This function collates the queries and data location before running the script.
